## This pair of functions, cache the inverse of a matrix. 
## It is assumed that the matrix supplied is always invertible

## makeVector creates a special "vector", which is matrix containing a function

  
  makeVector <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
      x <<- y
      m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
  }


## The following function calculates the mean of the special "matrix" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.
  
  cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
      message("getting cached data")
      return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
